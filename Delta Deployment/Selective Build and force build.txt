Entire DB module build:

Compares the file system version with HDI container version that was deployed before.

- Only changed objects are deployed, if no changes nothing happens.
- If any object is changed, it will be un-deployed first and deployed with new version. Takes care of dependencies.
- If the object is new, gets deployed directly.
   - if the object is removed, with automatic un-deployment setting, object will be dropped.

Selective build:

- We can select specific folder or file for deployment, only those objects are deployed.
- No dependencies are taken care though the dependency has a problem.
- If the selected object is new, it will be deployed directly.
- If the selected object is changed, it will be un-deployed and deployed after.
- If the selected object is no change, no action takes place on that.

Force build:

- Select one particular object and do the build, even though if it is not changed, it will un-deploy and deploy that object.
- If you select 2 or more, then it works as selective build only.
